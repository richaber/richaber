I'm Richard Aber, a seasoned WordPress developer.

I've been working with HTML since 1999, PHP since 2004, and WordPress since 2009.

I have been a developer, senior developer, and lead developer on hundreds of WordPress site builds. I have worked as a freelancer, a consultant, an in-house corporate developer, and an agency developer.

I have contributed to multiple "public" WordPress plugins. 

- [WP Search with Algolia](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wp-search-with-algolia/graphs/contributors
)
- [Constant Contact Forms](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/constant-contact-forms/graphs/contributors)
- [Constant Contact + WooCommerce](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/constant-contact-woocommerce/graphs/contributors)
- [Snow Monkey Blocks](https://github.com/inc2734/snow-monkey-blocks/issues/375)
- [Babble](https://github.com/Automattic/babble/issues/330)
- [WPGraphiQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphiql/issues/5) 

I have built many "private" WordPress plugins, either for specific client use cases, working with custom private APIs, or under NDA.

I love barbecue! I run a stick-burner offset smoker and a Weber kettle grill. If I'm not wrangling code, I'm probably cooking something outside!
