I'm Richard Aber, a seasoned WordPress developer.

I've been working with HTML since 1999, PHP since 2004, and WordPress since 2009.

I have held various dev roles such as developer, senior developer, lead developer, and development manager. My experience spans freelancing, consulting, corporate in-house development, and agency-based development.

I have worked on hundreds of WordPress websites, from small brochure sites, to complex sites for multinational corporations that consume data from multiple private APIs to assemble content dynamically.

I have contributed to multiple "public" WordPress plugins.

- [WP Search with Algolia](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wp-search-with-algolia/graphs/contributors
  )
- [Constant Contact Forms](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/constant-contact-forms/graphs/contributors)
- [Constant Contact + WooCommerce](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/constant-contact-woocommerce/graphs/contributors)

And I have built many, many more, "private" WordPress plugins and WP-CLI commands, for specific client use cases.

I love barbecue! I run a stick-burner offset smoker and a Weber kettle grill. If I'm not wrangling code, I'm probably cooking something outside!
